/**
 * 1) Finishing Link State Routing.
 *      GUI support for weighted links
 *      Need to transform ArrayList of NodeInformations received after convergence into a single NodeInformation to run Djikstra's on. 
 *      Need to have a way of running LS routing from GUI (currently I'm dumb and don't understand how to pass an argument to run - thread newbie here!)
 *      I've already implemented support for weighted links in the backend - currently it just builds every link with weight 1 but it DOES pass and process weights correctly!
 * 
 * 2) Threading.
 *      In theory, each router needs at least one thread. Currently the application kicks ass but it doesn't meet spec here!
 *      
 * 3) Report.
 *      The implementation should be accompanied by a report. The report should be at least 2 pages; at most 10 pages. 
 *      It should provide an abstract explanation of the two routing approaches, a description of the implementation
 *      and a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches.
 * 
 * 4) Unnecessary Nice Things.
 *      Have nodes in GUI flash when they receive a message? (via polling, every time their log increases in size?)
 *      Bring up the shortest path highlighting in red when calling a send method from inspect?
